    You need to provide the name of the routine. Let us start with "Daily exercises". The type of routine should be
    "Sport". By default created routines are enabled. If you will disable it you will not receive any
    reminders. You can also provide an optional description of the routine if you want. For exercises,
    it could be something like "My daily series of push-ups". When you click on
    <button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">
        <i aria-hidden="true" class="bi bi-save"></i>
        {{ button_label|default('Save'|trans) }}
    </button>
    your routine will be created.
