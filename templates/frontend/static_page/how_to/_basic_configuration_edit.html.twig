        Selecting Time zone
    </b>
    <br>
    After registration, you will not have a selected time zone. This step is essential because the system
    can not send you reminders on time if you don't provide time zone information. Now please click on
    <button class="btn btn-success btn-sm">
        <i aria-hidden="true" class="bi bi-geo-alt"></i>
        {{ 'Find time zone'|trans }}
    </button>.
    The system will try to autodetect your time zone. You will have a popup message in your browser. System
    asks for permission to use geolocation to detect your time zone.
    <br><br>
    If for some reason system is not able to detect your time zone, please select it. System displays
    time zones in format "Continent/City" where "City" is the capital of your country, state, or bigger city
    in your region.<br><br> For more information about time zones please check
