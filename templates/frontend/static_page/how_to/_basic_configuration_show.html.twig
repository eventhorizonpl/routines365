        There are two most important things that you need to check before you start using the system:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Email verification status
            </li>
            <li>
                Time zone
            </li>
        </ul>

        Verifying email
    </b>
    <br>
    After registration, you will have a <span class="badge badge-danger">{{ 'Not verified'|trans }}</span>
    label next to your email address. Please check your email account for an email with the subject
    "R365: Please confirm your email". There is a verification link inside that allows you to confirm your
    email address. This step is essential because the system can not send you reminders to not verified
    email. After you confirm the email please refresh the "Profile details" section and you will have a
    <span class="badge badge-success">{{ 'Verified'|trans }}</span> label next to the email.
