            We noticed that you didn't created any routines.<br><br>
            You can read the <a href="{{ url('frontend_static_page_how_to_routines') }}">documentation</a>.<br><br>
            You can take a <a href="{{ url('frontend_user_kyt_routines') }}">tutorial</a>.<br><br>
            We encourage you to take a tutorial. It will lead you through the process and you will get a reward for completing it.<br><br>
            Thanks,<br>
